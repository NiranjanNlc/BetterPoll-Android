# BetterPoll-Android
This is an android application which can be setup and used as a complete campus platform. A campus (eg.- a college campus) provides
many facilities such as a mess, shuttle services. BetterPoll is an attempt to create a completely open source campus management system.
This repository contains the frontend ( an android application) of the application. <br>

For the backend repo you can check out : https://github.com/adityabisht02/BetterPoll-Backend <br>

This project will have an admin side, the admin will be able to add services, timings etc. and the other users shall be able to see these services.

<h2> The User Side of the application : </h2>
The User side of the application is what the students(assuming a college campus) will see and interact with.
